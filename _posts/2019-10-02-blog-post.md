Background

One of my current project is to create a compact version of device taht consists of a STM32 MCU, a PIR sensor, a Bluetooth module, a temperature/humidity sensor, and a LC driver. 

For a LC driver, the electrical schematic is looks like this 

![LC driver schematic](http://libowu.com/images/LC_driver_schematic.png). 

The purpose of this circuit is to provide the liquid crystal cell an alternative current waveform of around 100 Hz. The amplitude of the AC signal depends on the Vdc (source). The ideal input and output waveform is like this:
