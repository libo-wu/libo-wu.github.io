* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Mechanical Engineeing](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Ya Wang](https://engineering.tamu.edu/mechanical/profiles/wang-ya.html).

* From 2015-2018, I was a Ph.D. candidate in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.stonybrook.edu/electrical/) at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/). I received my Bachelor's degree in [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) at 2015. 

* My research interests lie in the general area of embedded systems, particularly in smart devices, sensors, indoor human detection, as well as IoT and machine learning.
